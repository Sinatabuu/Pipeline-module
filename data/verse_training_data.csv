For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son,love
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want,comfort
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,strength
Be still and know that I am God,peace
Do not fear for I am with you,courage
Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you,comfort
Without faith it is impossible to please God,faith
Your word is a lamp to my feet,truth
We walk by faith not by sight,faith
The joy of the Lord is your strength,strength
